        "1. **Problem Definition**:  A clear definition of the problem enables us to identify the appropriate data to gather and technique(s) to use in order to solve the problem. For many problems this many require background reading, discussion with domain experts, and layered problem specification.\n",
        "2. **Data Gathering**: We have to know which data to use, where to gather them, and how to make them useful to solve our problem. In many cases, data from multiple sources can provide deeper insights.\n",
        "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of performing initial investigations on our data. EDA normally has descriptive nature and uses graphical statistics to discover patterns, to identify anomalies, to test hypothesis, and to check assumptions regarding our data.\n",
        "4. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Raw data are generally incomplete, inconsistent, and contain many errors. Thus, we need to prepare the data for further processing. Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes, such as analytics.\n",
        "5. **Data Modelling**:  Data modelling involves selecting and optiming the machine learning models that generate the best predictive performance based on the data we have.\n",
        "6. **Prediction**: Once we have developed the best predictive model, we can deploy it to make predictions.\n",

There is no need to go to the trouble of creating this model because the current solutions are already so simple and widespread. The second reason is that in a majority of healthcare settings it is common for healthcare professionals to measure and record a patients' vital signs at the beginning of a visit. A person's blood pressure is one of those vital signs. This means that a model predicting systolic blood pressure would not be \"useful\" because blood pressure is already a health statistic people have in their medical histories.
