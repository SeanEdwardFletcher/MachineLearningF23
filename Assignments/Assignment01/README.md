This assignment is a copy of this notebook (https://github.com/bruceMacLeod/COS475-575/blob/main/Assignment/HypertensionV1.ipynb).

The task: to improve the end to end analysis in multiple ways  


a) Read about the NHANES dataset, hypertension, and relevant biology background information (cardiac cycle, ...). 
Provide a better description of problem domain and approach to modeling it. 
This is a critically important part of ML that is often overlooked. The message is : know your problem domain !

b) Add additional categorical variables (at least one). This notebook only includes gender.
c) Add additional numerical fields (at least five). Look at other tables for relevant variables.
d) Add more data. This notebook only has 2017-March 2020
e) Try at least one other Machine Learning algorithm
f) Do more exploratory data analysis and visualization
g) Improve the way that systolic data fields are used. The current notebook throws away all records that do not have all 3 readings. Change so that a single reading is used or multiple readings are averaged.
h) Implement Cross-validation for one your Machine learning techniques
